# Encrypter
Welcome to thee Encrypter! This program can encrypt user input in two different ways (more functionality in the works)!

### So far it can:
- Invert input strings
- Offset input strings

## How it looks so far:
The program starts by asking the user to write something:
<p align="center"> <img src="imgs/Encrypter 1.png" width=940> </p>

Then it asks the user how they would like to encrypt the message. Let's start by inverting it! First tthe user enters '1' to invert the input, then enters '3' to display it:
<p align="center"> <img src="imgs/Encrypter 2.png" width=940> </p>

The inversion process flips the number of the lettter (for instance, 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, etc.) over an imaginary center axis of the alphabet. This way, 'a' becomes 'z', 'b' becomes 'y', 'c' becomes 'x' and so on. In this case, "Hello Friends!" becomes "Svool Uirvmwh!".

Now let's try the offset function, this time we'll use numbers:
<p align="center"> <img src="imgs/Encrypter 3.png" width=940> </p>

The user inputs what they want converted, and then after they choose to offset the input, the user is asked to input how much they would like to offset the input by. In this case it is offset by 2, therefore, the number '1' becomes '3', '2' becomes '4', etc. This also works with letters! 'a' would become 'c' and 'b' would become 'd' and so on. Notice how symbols (like '+' and '=', as well as the '!' in the previous example, are left as they are).

Thanks for checking out my project!
